                            <p class="web-text">For a country with an estimated 35% of households that are considered to be living in poverty [3] out-of-pocket healthcare costs pose a serious financial barrier to many. [4]</p>
                            <p class="web-text">The World Health Organization states that El Salvador is ‘one of the few countries in Latin America considered in crisis with regard to human resources of health (HRH)’, with low health spending and resource maldistribution among its systems greatest challenges [3].</p>
                            
                            <p class="web-text">El Salvador’s domestic government health expenditure as a percentage of total health expenditure has remained relatively constant since 2015 [2]. During the past two decades, out-of-pocket expenditure has remained nearly a third of current health expenditure in El Salvador, although it has slightly decreased from roughly 33% to 29% from 2010-2018.                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="web-text">Many households in El Salvador are supported in their daily lives through remittances. Personal remittances as a % of the country’s GDP rose from 18% to 24% of the country’s GDP during 2010-2020 [2]. Remittances have rebounded after an early pandemic drop, recently reaching a record high of benefiting 360,000 households [1].                            </p>

                            <p class="web-text">Of the remittance recipients in El Salvador, 79% are classified as poor or at risk of falling into poverty [3] with remittances providing households basic spending power. On average, remittances account for half of a household's total monthly income for remittance recipients [3]. It has estimated that one in twenty remittance recipient households spend remittances on healthcare costs [3].

                            <p class="web-text">What type of aid is prevalent among those with out-of-pocket healthcare costs in El Salvador, remittances and/or government aid?</p>

                            <h3>Methodology</h3>
                            <p class="web-text">Using data provided by the World Food Program and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) that collected data from “approximately 5,000 household interviews and over 6,000 web survey responses across the three countries”, we investigated respondent households from El Salvador regarding questions surrounding remittances, healthcare spending, and forms of aid in health.</p>
                            <p class="web-text">Specifically, among all households from El Salvador that indicated non-zero six-month out-of-pocket health costs, we split groups based upon whether or not they indicated receiving remittances. For each group, remittances versus non-remittances, we explore the distribution of health care costs, presence of health concerns, and indicators of receiving government and/or church, NGO, non-profit health aid.</p>

                               With high out of pocket health expenditures, this may point to <mark class="highlighted-main">lack of access or high barriers of entry</mark> to recieve this aid.

                                For example, El Salvador's government health service, MSPAS, is meant to reach <strong>80%</strong> of the population. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that in practice, only <strong>40%</strong> receive aid on a regular basis.

                            <p class="web-text">Almost no households receive aid from the government or NGOs.</p>

                            <p class="web-text">
                                Remittances are an enormous impact for receiving families. We beleive increased assistance from governments or NGOs can alleviate household spending on healthcare and result in increased economic participation within El Salvador.

                            <p class="web-text">Make public health aid more attainable for informal workers, which comprise a majority of Salvadorans.</p>
                            <p class="web-text">NGOs such as The World Bank and the WHO are encouraged to revisit and reexamine the current healthcare system.</p>
                            <p class="web-text">The US Government should formally support migration working channels such as the Global Skill Partnership Model to provide economic mobility to those in El Salvador.</p>
