                            <p>
                                With an estimated 35% of its households classified as living under poverty [Cite WHO 2010], El Salvador’s population has faced the burden of an underresourced and inequitable health care system. 
                                Specifically, out-of-pocket healthcare costs present great financial barriers to much of the country’s population.  The World Health Organization states that El Salvador is ‘one of the few countries 
                                in Latin America considered in criss with regard to human resources of health (HRH)’, with low health spending and resource maldistribution among its systems greatest challenges [Cite WHO].

                            <p>
                                El Salvador’s National Health Service (NHS) has been described as “persistently underfunded”, and El Salvador’s government health expenditure has remained relatively constant since 2015, 
                                while health expenditure per captia increased by nearly 20% from 2015-2020 [Cite]. 
                                Out of pocket expenditure has remained nearly a third of current health expenditure, although slightly decreasing from 33% to 29% from 2010-2018 [Cite]

                            <p>
                                Many households in El Salvador are supported in their daily lives through remittances, primarily those from migrants in the United States [Source] as personal remittances has risen from 18% to 24% of the country’s GDP from 2010-2010 [source], even rebounding after an early pandemic drop and reaching a record high benefiting 360,000 households [AP news]. Of the remittance recipients in El Salvador, 79% are classified as poor or at risk of falling into poverty [Source], with remittances providing households basic spending power.                            </p>

                            <p>
                                While on average, remittances account for half of household’s total monthly income for remittance recipients, this proportion is even greater for households with head of household (HOH) aged 60+ (57%) and rural households (62%).  Such households that receive remittances face the greatest financial barriers to receiving healthcare - and [soruce] reports that one in twenty remittance recipient households spend remittances on healthcare costs.
