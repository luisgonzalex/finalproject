# 11.154 Final Project
This class studies data visualization as a way for architects, planners and policy experts to communicate with the public.

Each year the class works with a “client” focusing on a theme, this year's theme was developed in coordination with the [World Food Program](https://www.wfpusa.org/) and the [Migration Policy Institute](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/) to look at the root causes of migration.

Our project analyzes healthcare spending in El Salvador and show how remittances help households to cover costs associated to healthcare.
